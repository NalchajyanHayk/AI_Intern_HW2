    "The code includes three individual descriptor classes: Int, Float, and List. Each descriptor class defines the __set_name__, __set__, and __get__ methods to handle attribute assignment, type validation, and attribute retrieval. To optimize the code and avoid repeating similar code blocks, a new descriptor class called ValidType is introduced. This class takes a type parameter during initialization and validates that the assigned value matches the specified type. It handles type validation for various attribute types, such as integers, floats, lists, and tuples. The Person class utilizes these descriptor classes to define specific attributes: age, height, tags, favorite_foods, and name. Each attribute is assigned an instance of the ValidType descriptor class with the corresponding type. By using these descriptors, any attempt to assign an incorrect type to these attributes will raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message indicating the expected type."
